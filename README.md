"Acquisition of knowledge"

##About
With this app, users can organize Khan Academy lessons by type, tags, video duration, and theme, as well as a “Wire” feature that keeps track of progress and where you can enter in a specific amount of time you’d like to learn.

##User Story Example
###Jake is interested in learning Math and Computer engineering. He wants to learn at a quick pace, but can’t find enough time and needs a timeline that helps keep him motivated and keep track of goals while fitting into his busy schedule. He also wants to be able to add his friends/family and share what he’s learned with them or suggest lessons.
