# BrushUp
"Your mind is a canvas"

##About
With this app, users can organize Khan Academy lessons by type, tags, video duration, and theme, as well as a “Wire” feature that keeps track of progress and where you can enter in a specific amount of time you’d like to learn.

The intention for this app is to appeal to a younger and modern demographic and create something more creative, social, and to act as a simple goal-setting and educational resource.

###Social Functionality

By adding a more interactive and social aspect to the website, users can login and view saved lessons as well as share them with friends and family.

###User Story Example
Jake is interested in learning Math and Computer engineering. He wants to learn at a quick pace, but can’t find enough time and needs a timeline that helps keep him motivated and keep track of goals while fitting into his busy schedule. He also wants to be able to add his friends/family and share what he’s learned with them or suggest lessons.

##Technologies and Frameworks

This app is built in the Rails framework and the primary languages are Ruby, SASS, HTML/CSS. Libraries include JQuery, Velocity.js, Cloudinary, Facebook oAuth, Materialize, and Foundation.
